verilog project


In a typical processor Multiplication is one of the basic arithmetic operations . It requires substantially more hardware resources and processing time than addition and subtraction . Infact , 8.72% of all instructions in typical processing units is multipliers . 

In this project "Urdhva Tiryakbhyam" algorithm of Ancient Indian Vedic Mathematics is utilized for multiplication to improve the speed and area parameters of multipliers .
